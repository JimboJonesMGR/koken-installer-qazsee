# Installing Koken

Sadly, it appears that the Koken project has been abandoned. The download link no longer works on koken.me. I modified the install script for the latest version so you can still install and use this awesome app.

Just drop these files into the directory you'd like to install Koken under, set the permissions to 777 and run the installer in your browser.

Modified install script to install the abandoned Koken app- But.. 

Jimbo Jones MGR is picking up the ball. I am runnin it in fur a TD. I used this script to build an awesome game site a long time ago. I got some very useful tweaks that will keep those interested still in full user mode. First I am adding a picture library with all the game systems and rom pictures. NOT THE ROM IMAGES that you play. Just the icons and splash screens. all you have to do is install it and you will have a masterindex of game icons, systems and splash screens. From there you can put your own video game site together. Happy Koken!
